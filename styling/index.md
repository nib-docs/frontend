### [Pattern Library](https://nib-pattern-library.firebaseapp.com/)

A library of patterns detailing when and how to use the standard UI components in order to deliver a consistent online branding for nib.

The components can be found here:

- [icons](https://github.com/nib-styles/v2-icons)
- [typography](https://github.com/nib-styles/v2-typography)
- [buttons](https://github.com/nib-styles/v2-buttons)
- [forms](https://github.com/nib-styles/react-form)

### [Grid](https://github.com/nib-styles/sass-grid)

A responsive grid built on flexbox. The grid provides both, a set of mixins and a set of classes for creating
responsive layouts.

- [examples](http://digitaledgeit.github.io/sass-grid/example/example.html)
- [breakpoints](https://github.com/nib-styles/sass-breakpoints#breakpoints)
- [migrating from the old grid](../appendix/migrating-from-the-old-grid.md)

> The grid uses custom attributes. Use the [react-sass-grid-support](https://github.com/nib-components/react-sass-grid-support)
package to make it work with React.

### [Spacing](https://github.com/nib-styles/sass-spacing)

Responsive margin and padding classes (and mixins).
