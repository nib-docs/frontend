    TODO:
    - binding in the constructor
    - using mapDispatchToProps to make testing simpler

    Learning CSS:
      SCSS syntax (concentrate on variables, functions, mixins and the root selector)
      Knowing what BEM is and understanding the reasons behind it
      The grid we use
    Learning JS:
      ES6/7 syntax (concentrate on syntax rather than new objects – sets, symbols etc)
      Promises
      npm
      Semver
    Learning React:
      General react usage (fundamentals)
      Knowing what Higher Order Components are
      Knowing what Container/Smart vs Dumb components are
      Stateless functional components
      Shallow rendering for unit testing
    Learning Redux:
      Watching Dan Ambrov’s Egghead tutorials
      Using our tooling:
      Use the generator to create various app types (note: nib specific one can be found here but requires private npm access to npm install all our packages)
